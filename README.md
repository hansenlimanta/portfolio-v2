# Portfolio V2

## Description
Portfolio V2 is my latest personal portfolio project, drawing inspiration from the design and structure of Brittany Chiang's Portfolio. The objective is to reverse engineer aspects of the website to gain insights into its layout, style, and functionality. The portfolio is divided into three main sections: About, Experience, and Projects, providing visitors with a comprehensive view of my skills and achievements.
